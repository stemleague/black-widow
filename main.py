alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz "
message = "hello world" # this is a testing message

############### Encoding Process ###############
# In this step we are going to encode a string to become a secret list.

# Step 1: Reverse the message string

# Step 2: Create a list called secret_list

for letter in message:
  # Step 3: Store the index of each letter from alphabet in a variable called letter_value

  # Step 4: Add the letter_value to your secret_list

# Step 5: Print secret list


############### Decoding Process ###############
# In this step we are going to decode the message in the secret list.

# Step 6: Reverse secret_list

# Step 7: Create a string called decoded_message

for index in secret_list:
  # Step 8: Find the character in the alphabet that corresponds to the index and add it to your decoded message

# Step 9: Print your decoded message.
